There is no doubt that most of our childhood was spent watching anime, we have seen and experienced it all. With Hacktoberfest 2022 coming up and being one of the people who would participate for the very first time(as maintainer), I decided to create this repository that's actually a very basic web-page that lets the user view and add their favourite characters.

You can find all types characters on https://kimetsu-no-yaiba.fandom.com/wiki/Characters

# Contents of the Webpage

1. index.html - Contains the content of the main/home page.
2. style.css - Contains the styling given to the home page.

# What can you contribute?

There is always something to contribute to a project whether you are a novice or a veteran. In this project, you can add your favourite character as a card to the website! Or maybe you didn't like the line that you are reading right now and want to change that. Sure! Why not?

# How can you contribute?

# But what if i don't know how to add cards? :(

Not everyone is aware of every tool present in the world no matter how easy or complex it is. It's also not necessary to know each and every tool out there. Use the code below to add the your own card!

<b>Code -</b>

                <!-- [character name] card start-->
                <div class="card">
                  <div class="img__container">
                    <img src="images/[name].png" alt="[name]">
                  </div>
                  <div class="container">
                      <h4><strong>[name]</strong></h4>
                      <p>[Character Description]</p>
                  </div>
                </div>
                <!--[character name] card end-->

Copy this code and paste it in the index.html file to make your changes. Try and test it on your own system and then create a Pull request. You can adjust height of image of character so that it will fit in card.
